      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Nathaniel Gaffney.</p>
      <p>I'm an aspiring programmer from Spartanburg, South Carolina, and I am enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering
        Immersion course to eventually get a job as a Back End Developer.</p>
      <p>I want to provide an array of services to my clients, ranging from HTML and CSS development, to Javascript development.</p>

    <!--About me-->
    <article id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've always loved knowing how things work, and why they work. It's no different with programming. I have an
        Associate's Degree in Industrial Electronics Technology from Spartanburg Community College. My initial
        attraction to the field was due to the nature of the problem solving involved in troubleshooting. I decided
        however that the industrial field wasn't for me and I wanted to be closer to my other passions. When I finally
        got involved with the idea of programming, I started seeing the similarities in logical problem solving between
        programming and my previous field of study. Learning more I discovered a ton of benefits to working in the field
        and got sucked in more and more. Now that I'm doing this course at Thinkful, I'm ecstatic to see all the
        possibilities I have in my future, and also the security I'll be able to provide myself and my family.</p>
      <p>My programming goals are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide a better future for my family.</li>
        <li>To learn new skills that will further my expertise.</li>
        <li>To write good code that other developers can enjoy working off of.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Outside of programming, I love to play guitar and write progressive instrumental music. I'd love to be able to
        share it with more people than I already have. I also love playing games with my friends and family, whether
        it's video games, board games, or RPGs.
