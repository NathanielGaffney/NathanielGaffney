          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Nathaniel Gaffney.</p>
          <p>I'm an aspiring programmer from Spartanburg, South Carolina, and I am enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering Immersion course to eventually get a job as a Back End Developer.</p>

        <!--About me-->
        <article id = "about-me">
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I've always loved knowing how things work, and why they work. It's no different with programming. I have an Associate's Degree in Industrial Electronics Technology from Spartanburg Community College. My initial attraction to the field was due to the nature of the problem solving involved in troubleshooting. I decided however that the industrial field wasn't for me and I wanted to be closer to my other passions. When I finally got involved with the idea of programming, I started seeing the similarities in logical problem solving between programming and my previous field of study.  Learning more I discovered a ton of benefits to working in the field and got sucked in more and more.  Now that I'm doing this course at Thinkful, I'm ecstatic to see all the possibilities I have in my future, and also the security I'll be able to provide myself and my family.</p>
          <ul><h4>My programming goals are:</h4>
            <li>To provide a better future for my family.</li>
            <li>To learn new skills that will further my expertise.</li>
            <li>To write good code that other developers can enjoy working off of.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Outside of programming, I love to play guitar and write progressive instrumental music. I'd love to be able to share it with more people than I already have. I also love playing games with my friends and family, whether it's video games, board games, or RPGs.
