      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Nathaniel Gaffney.</p>
      <p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Spartanburg, South Carolina. I have completed Thinkful's Engineering Immersion course.  I have since went on to complete several jobs in contract work for TEKsystems. Including Application Support for AmWins, a leading global specialty insurance distributor, and Software Development for Bank of America.</p>
      <p>I aim to deliver quality development solutions whether it be in Javascript, C#, HTML, CSS, or any language that my employers or clients desire.</p>

    <!--About me-->
    <article id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've always loved knowing how things work, and why they work. It's no different with programming. I have an
        Associate's Degree in Industrial Electronics Technology from Spartanburg Community College. My initial
        attraction to the field was due to the nature of the problem solving involved in troubleshooting. I decided
        however that the industrial field wasn't for me and I wanted to be closer to my other passions. When I finally
        got involved with the idea of programming, I started seeing the similarities in logical problem solving between
        programming and my previous field of study. Learning more I discovered a ton of benefits to working in the field
        and got sucked in more and more. After completing the Engineering Immersion Program at Thinkful, I completed contract work at AmWins for the contractor TEKsystems.  At AmWins I learned even more about working with other developers, troubleshooting large-scale applications, and using new project management tools such as Azure DevOps. After completing my contract with Amwins, I moved on to develop for Bank of America, where I worked with a larger team to develop new features and solutions, as well as learning Jira and how to interface with a larger company.  I'm ecstatic to see all the
        possibilities I have in my future, and to find other developers to collaborate with.</p>
      <p>My programming goals are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide a better future for my family.</li>
        <li>To learn new skills that will further my expertise.</li>
        <li>To write good code that other developers can enjoy working with.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Outside of programming, I love to play guitar and write progressive instrumental music. I'd love to be able to
        share it with more people than I already have. I also love playing games with my friends and family, whether
        it's video games, board games, or TTRPGs.
